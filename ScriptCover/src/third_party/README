This is a fork of UglifyJS library used by ScriptCover Tool.

The main changes:
- When JS code is built using AST tree, instrumentation code is inserted.
  For every semantic block,
  - "%BRT_BLOCK_BEGIN%
     window.scriptObjects[%BRT_SCRIPT_INDEX%].executedBlock[%BRT_BLOCK_COUNTER%]
     = true;" is added to its beginning;
  - "%BRT_BLOCK_END%" is added at the end.
- Several Node.js specific exports were commented to provide independency.
